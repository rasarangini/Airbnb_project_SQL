Airbnb has revolutionized the travel and hospitality industry by offering a platform where homeowners can rent out their properties to travelers. Performed a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb listings in New York City. This includes data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and addressing specific business questions through SQL queries.
Recommendations:
Focus on providing resources and support to hosts in neighborhoods like Holliswood, which have lower average ratings(3.78).
Many listings fall under the "No Rating" category. Encourage guests to leave reviews by offering incentives such as discounts on future bookings.
Given that 22% of hosts have multiple listings, develop a certification or rewards program to ensure these hosts maintain high standards across all their properties.
Identify and support hosts in neighborhoods like Rossville, Neponsit, West Farms, and Navy Yard, which have perfect average ratings.
Provide hosts with regular market analysis reports highlighting trends in pricing and occupancy.
Highlight budget-friendly neighborhoods like Little Neck, Hunts Point, and Grant City to attract cost-conscious travelers.
Focus on increasing listings in high-demand neighborhoods like Oakwood, New Springville, and Emerson Hill.
Investigate and address issues with listings that have low availability and no ratings.
Continue to enforce strict regulatory compliance to maintain the current 100% licensing rate.
With 29% of listings having expired reviews, encourage hosts to keep their listings active and updated.
Provide ongoing education and support for hosts to ensure they understand and comply with local regulations.
